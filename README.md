# IPA Beer Taste Analysis

### Introduction:
The craft beer industry in the US has grown tremendously over the past decade. Of the types of beer that are new to the market, India Pale Ales (IPAs) seem to be the most popular. IPAs are known for their bold, bitter and hoppy taste, and while many fanatics can't get enough of this unique taste, the IPA critics are driven away by those exact features. This project aims to analyze the popularity of IPA's taste using a beer review dataset.

### Dataset:
The dataset utilized for this analysis is the "Beer Profile and Ratings Data Set" (beer_profile_and_ratings.csv).  
The following information is posted on the Kaggle page where the dataset is located. (The link to full description and information: https://www.kaggle.com/ruthgn/beer-profile-and-ratings-data-set)

Below is an overview/summary description of the dataset.

This data set contains tasting profiles and consumer reviews for 3197 unique beers from 934 different breweries. It was created by integrating information from two existing data sets on Kaggle:  
**Beer Tasting Profiles Dataset**  
**1.5 Million Beer Reviews**


This project intends to demonstrate processes of data processing, cleaning, and analysis with the Python language and the Pandas package in Python. The origination of the project is from the course Computing for Data Analysis (CSE 6040), which is a part of the Master of Science in Analytics program at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech).
